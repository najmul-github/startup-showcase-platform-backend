## Project Description

You are asked to develop an MVP for the startup showcase platform. This platform will allow startup founders to showcase their products, provide detailed demonstrations, and pitch to potential investors. There will be two types of investors on the platform: Institutional investors and crowdfunding investors. Startup founders need to create two types of pitches - one for Institutional investors and another for crowdfunding investors. Your goal is to develop the core features of this platform using Laravel for the backend, VueJs for the front end, and MySql for the database.
